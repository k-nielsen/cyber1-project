### Previously nmapdetec.py, renamed and with more functionality towards TCP based port 
## Ideas for program: "bonsaiviking - they see me scannin they hatin"
## TODO: Threshold value is reused - it shouldn't be..
## TODO: Make the "known services" detection method keep a track of which unused ports each scanning IP has probed
